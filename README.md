# **PaPy** - Parallel Pipelines in Python

The `papy` package provides an implementation of the flow-based
programming paradigm in Python that enables the construction and
deployment of distributed workflows.

The `NuMap` package is a parallel (thread- or process-based, local or
remote), buffered, multi-task, `itertools.imap` or
`multiprocessing.Pool.imap` function replacment. Like `imap` it
evaluates a function on elements of a sequence or iterable, and it does
so lazily. Laziness can be adjusted via the \"stride\" and \"buffer\"
arguments. Unlike `imap`, `NuMap` supports **multiple pairs** of
function and iterable **tasks**. The **tasks** are **not** queued rather
they are **interwoven** and share a pool or **worker** \"processes\" or
\"threads\" and a memory \"buffer\".

Documentation can be found [here](http://mcieslik-mctp.github.io/papy/)

The package is tested on Python 2.7.6
